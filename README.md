# Project Title

Creating Your First Token

## Description

In this project, we create a token of our own name and deploy it on the blockchain using the REMIX EDITOR.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* We need an ethereum virtual machine to code this program. It is required to download multiple files to setup a working EVM. So, we code this program on REMIX Editor which is like a simulation and gives a real world experience on blockchain.
  
### Executing program
* The code given is in a working condition and no change is required. You can copy and paste it on REMIX Editor and simply compile and deploy the contract on the blockchain.

## Help

Any advise for common problems or issues.
```
Sometimes the functions MINT and BURN shows infinite gas prompt. But don't worry. Keep doing your code and it won't bother you during compilation.
